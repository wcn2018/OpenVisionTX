# OpenVisionTX
Open Source library and eventually application for computer vision and identification in model aircraft.

This idea is very, very early in its development, but I'm also quite interested in the idea.
Model aircraft/RC is a great hobby, and I want to contribute to it what I can. Right now, FPV and other camera technologies for drones/model planes are really beginning to take off. I want to develop software that eases the implementation of computer vision and convolutional nueral networks in these camera systems. These models could be used for the following purposes:
- identifying terrain features
- identifying people/animals on the ground.
- tracking a vehicle or other target.
- recognizing obstacles.
- basic topography (just for fun)

Right now it's honestly a very general concept. I want to eventually find a very specific challenge in model aviation to tackle and train a computer vision model for that purpose, then provide the network and its functions/interface open source for anyone. Because FPV is relatively cheap (unless you want high quality), I think this has a potentially wide interest depending on what I decide to tackle. I also want this software to interface with dirt cheap chinese android phones to use them as cameras. I mean those things are like $40 that's the price of decent FPV and they even come with GPS, accel, data, and storage.

<strong> what about the "TX"? </strong>
For now this more or less is just to denote the project's relation to model aviation. Various functionalities of this software could eventually be controlled using standard RC transmitter gear, though that's unlikely to be needed.

Important note: this idea pretty much evolved out of my desire to make a UAV using an old plane of mine, essentially to fly in circles and perform basic takeoff/landing autonomously. <strong> This software may end up evolving into a UAV control framework </strong>
