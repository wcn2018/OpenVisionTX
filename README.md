# OpenVisionTX
Open Source library and eventually application for computer vision and identification in model aircraft.

This idea is very, very early in its development, but I'm also quite interested in the idea.
Model aircraft/RC is a great hobby, and I want to contribute to it what I can. Right now, FPV and other camera technologies for drones/model planes are really beginning to take off. I want to develop software that eases the implementation of computer vision and convolutional nueral networks in these camera systems. These models could be used for the following purposes:
- identifying terrain features
- identifying people/animals on the ground.
- tracking a vehicle or other target.
- recognizing obstacles.
- basic topography (just for fun)
Right now it's honestly a very general concept. I want to eventually find a very specific challenge in model aviation to tackle and train a computer vision model for that purpose, then provide the network and its functions/interface open source for anyone. 

Important note: this idea more or less evolved out of my desire to make a UAV using an old plane of mine, essentially to fly in circles and perform basic takeoff/landing autonomously. <strong> This software may end up evolving into a UAV control framework </strong>
